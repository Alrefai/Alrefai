### Hey, I'm Mohammed! 👋

I architect resilient systems where elegant code meets exceptional user experience.

🔧 **Background**: Full-Stack Engineer with systems thinking from mechanical engineering. I love bringing engineering precision to TypeScript & cloud-native architectures!

💻 **Focus**: React frontends, Node/Deno backends, serverless architectures, edge computing  

🔐 **Philosophy**: Security-first 🔒, Privacy-always 🛡️, Performance-driven ⚡

🎯 **Approach**: Functional programming with obsessive attention to type safety (TypeScript strict mode is my happy place 🤓)

🚀 **Currently exploring**: Edge databases, Local-first development, and the Deno ecosystem

*"Where most see code, I see systems waiting to be optimized."*
